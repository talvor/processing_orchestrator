# Processing Orchestrator

The Processing Orchestrator is a CLI tool built using Cobra to automate workflows defined in a YAML configuration. It loads a series of steps, each with commands, inputs, and outputs, and executes them one by one.

## Configuration File

The orchestrator uses a YAML configuration file to define workflows. Each workflow contains multiple steps. Each step defines the following:

- **`name`**: Unique name for the step.
- **`command`**: Command line execution string.
- **`inputs`** *(optional)*: Files or data needed by the step.
- **`outputs`** *(optional)*: Output files generated by the step.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Download Data"
    command: "wget https://example.com/data.csv -O data.csv"
    outputs:
      - "data.csv"

  - name: "Process Data"
    command: "python process.py data.csv processed_data.csv"
    inputs:
      - "data.csv"
    outputs:
      - "processed_data.csv"

  - name: "Generate Report"
    command: "Rscript generate_report.R processed_data.csv report.pdf"
    inputs:
      - "processed_data.csv"
    outputs:
      - "report.pdf"
```

## Usage

1. Place your workflow YAML configuration file in a directory.
2. Run the `process` command with the path to your configuration:

```bash
processing_orchestrator process path/to/workflow.yaml
```

## Example Workflow

Step 1: Download a dataset.
Step 2: Preprocess and clean the dataset using a Python script.
Step 3: Generate a final report using an R script.

Customize the YAML configuration to suit your particular workflow.
